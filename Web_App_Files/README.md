Trigonometry Function Visualizer

Overview
The Trigonometry Function Visualizer is a Flask-based web application designed to graph trigonometric functions and their inverses. It provides users with functionality to find the domain and range of these functions, identify vertical asymptotes for tangent and cotangent functions, and determine horizontal asymptotes for their inverses, along with the end behaviors for each function.

Features

- Graphing trigonometric functions: sine, cosine, tangent, and cotangent.
- Plotting inverses of trigonometric functions.
- Calculating and displaying the domain and range.
- Identifying vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

Requirements:

Python 3
Pip (Python package manager)
Flask

Installation

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Required Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
*Make sure that you are in the correct location of the files


Running the Application

1. Start the Flask App:
   python3 run.py

2. Access the Application:
   Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/

How to use:
